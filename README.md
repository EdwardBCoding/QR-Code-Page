## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- CSS Variables
- CSS Flexbox


### What I learned

Through this project I practiced using Variables to keep my colors organized. I solidified some knowledge on flexbox, padding and margins and how to manipulate them. I grew to appreciate box shadow and its nuances in spread vs blur.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to become more comfortable with moving objects around more than just centering as well as wanting to learn more in terms of responsiveness. I would also like a better control of my flex boxes and whats inside (text sticking out of the box, image taking up the whole area, etc.).

### Useful resources

- [Google](https://www.google.com/) - Because who can do anything without google.
- [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site#creating-your-site) - Through this project I also learned how to manage and host a page through GitHub Pages.
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/bottom) - This helped me with moving an object besides just centering it. I used this for the text at the bottom of the screen.
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24254127/html-image-wont-display) - I had an issue with linking the QR image. Turns out theres a difference of absolute vs relative location which this helped me understand
